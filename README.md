# tolocal.host

Make your localhost life easier: tolocal.host and *.tolocal.host resolve to 127.0.0.1!

</div>

## Overview

[tolocal.host](http://tolocal.host) and [*.tolocal.host](http://tolocal.host) (all subdomains) resolve to `127.0.0.1` so you can use it for local development!

Normally you would have to create hosts file entries for different domains pointing to `127.0.0.1`. This is can be very cumbersome!

[tolocal.host](http://tolocal.host) solves this by resolving the domain name and all subdomains to `127.0.0.1`, so you can use it right away! Here are a few examples:

- tolocal.host
- mysite.tolocal.host
- test.tolocal.host
- node-backend.tolocal.host
- sub1.sub2.sub3.tolocal.host

All of them will point to `127.0.0.1`.

[tolocal.site](http://tolocal.site) also belongs to me and resolves to 127.0.0.1 aswell.

**Note:** [tolocal.host](http://tolocal.host) also supports IPv6, the AAAA records resolves to `::1`.

## About

This site is inspired by lvh.me, which does exactly the same! I just always forgot the name, so I registered [tolocal.host](http://tolocal.host), edited the DNS to point it to 127.0.0.1 and created this page. It's very simple really!
